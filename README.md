# Ticket Master Events

The application allows users to filter events by location and provide a start and end datetime. The goal of this project was not only to meet the requirements of the challenge but also to demonstrate my approach to problem-solving and technical skills.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [Shadcnui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) â€“ A component library.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) - A TypeScript-first RPC framework for building scalable APIs.
